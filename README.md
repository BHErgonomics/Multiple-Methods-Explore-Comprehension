## Background

Smart voice systems,  such as voice assistants and smart speakers,  are integral to domains such as smart homes, customer service, healthcare, and smart learning. The effectiveness of these systems relies on user comprehension performance,  which is crucial for enhancing user experience. In this study, the primary factors influencing comprehension performance in multilanguage smart voice systems is examined, and the efficacy of various analytical methods, including LASSO regression, SEM, PLSSEM, CNN, and BiLSTM, are assessed by identifying and improving these factors. Using a diverse dataset from humanâ€“computer interaction experiments made publicly available on GitHub, these five methods are applied to discern the impact of environmental and user specific factors on comprehension.

## Highlights

- Specific pathways with overall auditory and linguistic factors impacting user comprehension in multilanguage smart voice systems were identified via 5 methods, and BiLSTM achieved the best predictive performance.
- Notably, noise affected comprehension performance, which exhibited an inverted U-shaped curve, and certain rhythmic noises, such as those from clocks, enhanced this effect by creating a conducive auditory environment.
- Additionally, comprehension models vary significantly in native and nonnative language environments, indicating that linguistic diversity should be considered in system design.
